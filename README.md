# MiniChat

I created this small project to solidify what I learnt about PHP and manipulating SQL.

it is a simple chat application that allows everyone to write a message and it shows the username, the message and its date. And I also used cookies to store the username so the user won't have to write it every time.

Very simple :) yet help me solidify my knowledge.

You can check the [DEMO](http://cwmn.000webhostapp.com/moved/) if you feel so!

Hope you like it.
